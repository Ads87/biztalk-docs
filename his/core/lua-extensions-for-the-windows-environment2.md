# LUA Extensions for the Windows Environment
The extensions described in this section are designed for Microsoft® Windows®. They provide support for programming compatibility and optimum application performance in 32-bit operating environments. These extensions are supported on Platforms:  Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows 11, and Windows 10.  
  
 The Windows logical unit application (LUA) programming interface enables multithreaded Windows-based processes. A process contains one or more threads of execution. For each extension, this section provides a definition of the function with syntax, return codes, and remarks for using the extension.  
  
 These functions can be grouped into two categories depending on whether Request Unit Interface (RUI) or Session Level Interface (SLI) verbs are used.
