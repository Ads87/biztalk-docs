## [HIS Designer for Logic Apps](application-integration-ladesigner-2.md)

The HIS Designer for Logic Apps is a stand-alone tool that works with Microsoft Visual Studio to provide a graphical user interface for creating, viewing, and editing metadata objects that map to Mainframe programs and data.

## [Designing artifacts for CICS and IMS Integration](application-integration-lahostapps.md) 

CICS and IMS are two of the most used mainframe systems in the world. This linked article shows how to design the artifacts required by Azure Logic Apps to invoke these systems using low code techniques.

## [Designing artifacts for Host Files Integration](application-integration-lahostfiles.md)

IBM Host files such as VSAM files preserve data used in a variety of Mission Critical scenarios. This section detals the steps needed to design artifacts needed by Logic Apps to operate on this data offline in high throughput scenarios.
