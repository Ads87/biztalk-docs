# Get started with the 3270 Design Tool

Development tool for the IBM 3270 Connector for Azure Logic Apps.

## [The 3270 Design Tool](application-integration-3270designer-2.md)

This tool helps you record the screens, navigation paths, methods, and parameters for the tasks in your application that you add and run as 3270 connector actions. The tool generates a Host Integration Designer XML (HIDX) file that provides the necessary metadata for the connector to use for driving your mainframe application.

## [Designing Metadata artifacts for 3270 Integration](application-integration-la3270apps.md)  

3270 streams or green screen applications still run mission-critical systems in financial services, healthcare, and many other industries. This section details the strategies to integrate with these applications using the 3270 Design tool.
