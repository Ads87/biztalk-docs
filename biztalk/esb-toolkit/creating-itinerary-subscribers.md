# Creating Itinerary Subscribers
BizTalk Server automatically publishes messages arriving through a receive pipeline to the Message Box database; this makes the messages ready for pick-up by the relevant subscriber. This decoupled approach is the preferred way to develop BizTalk solutions because it provides maximum flexibility, scales well, and uses the publish-subscribe mechanism.  
  
 There are two ways to create an itinerary service subscriber:  
  
-   [Using a Send Port as an Itinerary Service Subscriber](../esb-toolkit/using-a-send-port-as-an-itinerary-service-subscriber.md)  
  
-   [Using an Orchestration as an Itinerary Service Subscriber](../esb-toolkit/using-an-orchestration-as-an-itinerary-service-subscriber.md)
