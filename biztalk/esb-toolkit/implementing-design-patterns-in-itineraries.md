# Implementing Design Patterns in Itineraries
This topic describes common service-oriented architecture (SOA) patterns and categories that can be implemented using the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)]. Each pattern category includes a description of each related pattern and links to more detailed information. The description of each individual pattern includes references to related [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] sample applications that implement the patterns and links to development activities designed to show developers how to create ESB solutions to implement these patterns. This section includes the following topic sections:  
  
-   [Message Routing Patterns](../esb-toolkit/message-routing-patterns.md)  
  
-   [Message Transformation Patterns](../esb-toolkit/message-transformation-patterns.md)  
  
-   [Service Mediation Patterns](../esb-toolkit/service-mediation-patterns.md)  
  
-   [Service Management Patterns](../esb-toolkit/service-management-patterns.md)
