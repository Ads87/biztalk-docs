# Maintaining BTARN Databases
MicrosoftÂ® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] databases can grow so large that their size can affect system performance. This can result from specific circumstances that leave unused entries in the tables, such as orphan attachments or unused digests. It can also occur from not deleting old entries in the tables. Follow the procedures in this section to maintain your [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] databases so there is no effect on performance.
