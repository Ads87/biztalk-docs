# Testing the Solution
In this section, you test your complete solution. You use the LOBWebApplication tool created in the Fabrikam solution to submit 3A2 PIP requests to the Contoso LOB application. The Contoso private orchestration that you created then submits a Contoso based 3A2 Price and Availability request to the ERP system using the SQL adapter for BizTalk Server. When the response is received from the ERP system, the orchestration calls the Business Rule Engine to enforce the emergency needs business policy that you created.
