# Customizing Private Processes
This section describes how to customize the private-process orchestrations that process service content. Microsoft [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] implements business processes that are internal to an organization as private processes. These processes are orchestrations that process the service-content message part. For more information, see [Private Processes](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/private-processes.md).
