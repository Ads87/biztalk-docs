# Troubleshooting JD Edwards OneWorld

## Overview
This section describes common issues and error messages that you might encounter in BizTalk Adapter for JD Edwards OneWorld, and provides possible corrections. In addition, it discusses the use of Event Tracing for Windows.  
  
 You can use the following debugging/tracing tools to troubleshoot the adapter:  
  
-   Native BizTalk Server debugging (for example, the Tracking Type on your port or the Orchestration Debugger).  
  
-   Error messages submitted to the Event Log.  
  
-   The capture of transmitter, receiver, and management messages through BTAJDEOneWorldTrace.cmd and a tool that converts the .etl files, such as tracerpt.exe or tracedmp.exe.
