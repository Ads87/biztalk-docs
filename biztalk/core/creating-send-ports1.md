# Creating Send Ports

## Overview
When you create a send port that uses Single Sign-On (SSO) and the affiliate application, you do not fill in the User name and Password parameters. You select **Yes** for **Use SSO** and select the SSO affiliate applications that you created to represent the TIBCO Enterprise Message Service system from the list.
