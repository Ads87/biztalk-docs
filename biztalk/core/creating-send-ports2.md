# Creating Send Ports
When you create a send port that uses Single Sign-On (SSO) and the affiliate application, you do not enter the User name and Password parameters. You select **Yes** for **Use SSO**, and then you select the SSO affiliate application that you created to represent the TIBCO Rendezvous system from the list.
