# Code Page (Node Property of Flat File Schemas)

 

Use the **Code Page** property to specify the code page to use with an instance message.

## Applies to Nodes of Type

[Schema](schema-node-properties.md)

## Category

Flat File

## Allowed Values

Any of the code pages available in the drop-down list, or a number that corresponds to a code page not in the list.

## Default Value

If no value is specified for the **Code Page** property, the default value is UTF-8. However, there are multiple other factors that play a role in determining the encoding scheme to use with an instance message. See remarks for more information.

## XSD Persistence

As the value of the **codepage** (="NNNN") attribute of the **schema/annotation/appinfo/schemaInfo** element.

## Remarks

You can examine and set this property in the Visual Studio Properties window when you select the **Schema** node in BizTalk Editor and you have configured the **Flat File Extension** option for the **Schema Editor Extensions** property of that node.

The values that you enter for this property are not validated. Therefore, if you type a value that is not valid, it may cause inaccurate results.

There are multiple factors that play a role in determining how character encoding for a given instance message is handled, as follows:

  - When disassembling a flat file instance message, the following algorithm is used to determine and preserve encoding information:
    
    1.  If the "Charset" in the body part is set, use it.
    
    2.  Otherwise, if the envelope (or document) schema specifies a code page, use it.
    
    3.  Otherwise, if a byte order mark is present, use it.
    
    4.  Otherwise, assume UTF-8.

  - When assembling a flat file instance message, the following algorithm is used to determine the charset to use for decoding:
    
    1.  If the "XMLNorm.TargetCharset" message context property is set, use it.
    
    2.  Otherwise, if the "TargetCharset" assembler (design-time) property is set, use it.
    
    3.  Otherwise, if the envelope (or document) schema specifies a code page, use it.
    
    4.  Otherwise, if the "SourceCharset" message context property is set, use it.
    
    5.  Otherwise, use UTF-8.
