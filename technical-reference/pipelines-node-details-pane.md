# Pipelines Node, Details Pane

 

Use the Pipelines node details pane to manage pipelines in the application. Right-click a specific pipeline to display the following commands:

  - **Remove**. Removes the selected pipeline from the application, and undeploys the assembly that contains it and the other components of that assembly. The application must be stopped before you can remove a pipeline.

  - **Move To Application**. Displays the **Move to Application** dialog box, which you use to move artifacts from the current application in the Administrative Console to a different application.

  - **Tracking**. Displays the **Pipeline Tracking Commands** window. This window is identical to the **Tracking** tab in the **Pipeline Properties** window.

  - **Properties**. Displays the **Pipeline Properties** window.
