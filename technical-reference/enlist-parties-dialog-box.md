# Enlist Parties Dialog Box

 

Use the **Enlist Parties** dialog box to enlist a party, which is an organization or application with which your organization has a business relationship, to a role, a logical entity that refers to a function, such as procurement or shipping. When you enlist parties on a role, you identify parties that can provide the service that the role requires.
