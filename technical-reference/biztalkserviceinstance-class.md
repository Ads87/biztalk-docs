# BizTalkServiceInstance Class

Â 

The **BizTalkServiceInstance** class implements the service contracts that the WCF adapters use to receive incoming messages. The WCF adapters create a separate **ServiceHost** and singleton service object of this class for each receive location to handle client requests for the lifetime of the BizTalk Host instance running WCF receive locations. The service object uses multiple threads to process messages concurrently unless the WCF-NetMsmq receive locations are used with the **Ordered processing** property being selected.
