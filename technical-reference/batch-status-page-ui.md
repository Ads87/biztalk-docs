## Batch Status Query Fields

**Batch Status**  
Specify that only batches with the selected status will be displayed in the status report.

The **Value** field can be **Defined**, **Active**, **Released**, **Completed**, or **All**. The default value is **Active**.

The **Operator** field can be **Equals** or **Not Equals**. The default value is **Equals**.

The **Defined** status indicates that batch settings have been created, but the batching orchestration is not active and is not collecting messages for the batch because the batch start date time is in the future.

The **Active** status indicates that the batching orchestration is active and collecting messages for the batch, because the batch start date time has been reached.

The **Released** status indicates that the batching orchestration has released the batch XML file to the MessageBox because the batch release criteria has been satisfied, but that the batch has not been sent by the send pipeline. It can also indicate that the batching orchestration was stopped before any messages were processed.

The **Completed** status indicates that the batch has been sent by the send pipeline.

This field is part of the default query.
