If you right-click an interchange in the query results on the EDI Interchange and Correlated ACK Status Page, and click the **Transaction set details** command, details about each transaction set in the interchange will be displayed. The results pane will include the following data (if all columns are included):

  - Transaction Set ID

  - Document Type

  - Sender party alias

  - Application Sender

  - Receiver party alias

  - Application Receiver

  - Direction

  - Interchange Control Number

  - Group Control Number

  - Transaction Set Control Number

  - Transaction Set Status

  - Interchange Date Time (not displayed by default)
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>For received documents, if the date specified in the interchange is YYMMDD format and YY is greater than or equal to 75, BizTalk Server will display the year as 19YY. If the date is less than 75, it will be displayed as 20YY.</P>
    > <P>For example, if you receive an interchange that contains the value 991113 in ISA09, the Interchange Date Time will be listed in the report as 11/13/1999.</P>
