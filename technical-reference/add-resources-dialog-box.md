<table>
<thead>

<th>Use this</th>
<th>To do this</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<td>Displays the name of the resource that you have selected to add to the application.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

</tr>
<tr class="odd">

</table>


## Options Tab

The **Options** tab displays special configuration for the resource you have selected in **Selected files to add**.

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Options - File type</strong></td>

<td>Type the path of the location to which the resource file will be copied when the application is installed, including the resource file name. An absolute path, relative path, or Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path are all acceptable. Folders that do not exist will be created upon installation if required security rights are in place and there is sufficient space. The default value in this box is as follows: <em>path of application installation folder</em>\<em>resource file name</em>. The path of the installation folder is specified by the %BTAD_InstallDir% environment variable. Example: %BTAD_InstallDir%\MyResource.xml.</td>
