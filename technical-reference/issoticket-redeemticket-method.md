# ISSOTicket.RedeemTicket Method

 

The **RedeemTicket** method redeems an Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) server ticket that was previously issued with the **IssueTicket** method.

## Syntax

``` c++
  
HRESULT RedeemTicket(  
BSTR bstrApplicationName,  
BSTR bstrTicket,  
LONG lFlags,  
BSTR* pbstrExternalUserName,  
SAFEARRAY BSTR  
);  
```

#### Parameters

`bstrApplicationName`  
\[in\] String that specifies the application name. This parameter cannot be NULL, an empty string, or contain spaces. Application names are not case-sensitive, but case will be preserved. For example, ABC, abc, and AbC are considered to be the same application.

`bstrTicket`  
\[in\] String that specifies the ticket value obtained from the **IssueTicket** method.

`lFlags`  
\[in\] Long integer that specifies the flags to set. Use the flag SSO\_FLAG\_REFRESH to indicate that the credential cache should be bypassed.

`pbstrExternalUserName`  
\[out\] Pointer to a string that receives the external user name associated with the ticket.

`BSTR`  
\[out\] String that receives the external credentials associated with the ticket. If there are no credentials, the size of the returned array is zero.

## Return Value

This method returns an HRESULT indicating whether it completed successfully. For more details, see the Error Values section.
