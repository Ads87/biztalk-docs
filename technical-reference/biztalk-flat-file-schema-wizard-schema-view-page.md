Â 

You use the **Schema View** page of the BizTalk Flat File Schema Wizard whenever you need to further define a record. This page of the wizard prompts you to select the next record to define, which you do by selecting the record that is not grayed out and then clicking **Next** to continue. If you have other records to further define, the **Schema View** page will again be displayed.
