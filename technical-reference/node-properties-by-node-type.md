# Node Properties - By Node Type

Â 

When you insert a node of any type into a schema, you will usually need to configure the node to suit your needs by setting one or more of its properties in the Visual Studio Properties window. Some node properties are common to more than one type of node, while other properties are unique to a particular type of node. For this reason, the BizTalk Editor property reference topics are organized in two ways. This section presents a summary of the node properties associated with each node type, and includes links to the individual node property reference topics.
