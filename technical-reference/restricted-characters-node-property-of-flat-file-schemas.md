# Restricted Characters (Node Property of Flat File Schemas)

Â 

Use the **Restricted Characters** property to define ranges of characters that are restricted in instance messages.

## Applies to Nodes of Type

[Schema](schema-node-properties.md)

## Category

Flat File

## Allowed Values

A set of zero or more non-overlapping character ranges, as configured in the **Restricted Characters** dialog box.

## Default Value

No restricted character ranges.

## XSD Persistence

Each restricted character range is persisted as the values of the **start** and **end** attributes of a **schema/annotation/appinfo/schemaInfo/restrictedCharacterRanges/interval** element.

## Remarks

You can examine and set this property in the Visual Studio Properties window when you select the **Schema** node in BizTalk Editor and you have configured the **Flat File Extension** option for the **Schema Editor Extensions** property of that node.

Click the ellipsis (**...**) button located to the right of the value field for this property to open the **Restricted Characters** dialog box. In this dialog box, specify one or more ranges of restricted characters.
