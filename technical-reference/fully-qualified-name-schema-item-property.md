# Fully Qualified Name (Schema Item Property)

Â 

Use the **Fully Qualified Name** property to examine the compiler-generated fully qualified name of the managed type of the selected schema file.

## Category

Advanced

## Read-Only Value

The compiler-generated fully qualified name of the managed type associated with the selected schema file, produced by combining the [Namespace](namespace-schema-item-property.md) and [Type Name](type-name-schema-item-property.md) properties, separated by a period (.).

## Remarks

You can examine this property in the Visual Studio Properties window when you select a schema file in Solution Explorer.

This property is read-only.

To avoid compilation errors, all items in a BizTalk project must have a unique value for their **Fully Qualified Name** property. Because you create the value of this property by concatenating the **Namespace** property, a period (.), and the **Type Name** property, you must make sure that the values you provide for these two properties, when combined, are unique within the BizTalk project.
