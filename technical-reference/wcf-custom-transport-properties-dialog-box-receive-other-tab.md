# WCF-Custom Transport Properties Dialog Box, Receive, Other Tab

 

Use the **Other** tab to specify the following:

  - The credentials for this receive location to use when polling an external service

  - Whether this receive location issues an SSO ticket

  - Whether this receive location preserves message order when processing messages

You can create a custom channel to poll an external service to retrieve response messages from the service like the SQL receive adapter and the FTP receive adapter do. If you configure the custom binding to use this custom channel, the receive location uses the specified credentials when sending solicit messages to an external service.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>For this receive location to use the credentials specified on the <STRONG>Other</STRONG> tab, you must use the <STRONG>ClientCredentials</STRONG> object that BizTalk Server passes along when implementing the custom channel and binding.</P>
