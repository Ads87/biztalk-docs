# Schema Editor Extensions Dialog Box

Â 

Use the **Schema Editor Extensions** dialog box to select which extensions to associate with this schema. Typically, such extensions provide additional properties for some of the node types in a schema tree that you use to store whatever additional characteristics exist for that type of schema. These characteristics are persisted as annotations associated with the relevant node in the schema.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Use this</th>
<th>To do this</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Check box associated with each schema extension</td>
<td>Configure whether the corresponding BizTalk Editor extension is associated with this schema.<br />
<br />
When you select an extension check box, the additional properties associated with the extension will become available in the Microsoft Visual Studio Properties window. Further, depending on the particular extension, a custom view of the schema may be available on a tab adjacent to the <strong>XSD</strong> tab.</td>
