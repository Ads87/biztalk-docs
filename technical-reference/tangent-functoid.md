# Tangent Functoid

 

Use the **Tangent** functoid ( ![Icon that represents the Tangent functoid.](images/Aa559950.3923b2f3-4edd-4d67-b7db-bac28447c7ad(BTS.80).jpeg)) to return the tangent of an angle.

## Input

**Parameter 1:** A numeric value that is an angle, specified in radians, for which the tangent is sought.

## Output

**Output 1:** A numeric value that is the tangent of the specified angle.

## Remarks

This functoid performs the following trigonometric calculation, where for a right triangle, A is one of the acute angles, S is the length of the non-hypotenuse adjacent side, and O is the length of the side opposite the angle.

Tangent(A) = O / S (tangent of angle is the opposite side over the adjacent side)

The tangent of an acute angle is sometimes informally referred to as "rise over run."

The **Tangent** functoid performs the inverse operation of the **Arc Tangent** functoid.

A radian is a unit of measure of angles, such that there are 2π radians in a circle. It follows that:

  - 2π radians equals 360 degrees

  - 1 radian = 180/π degrees

  - 1 degree = π /180 radians
