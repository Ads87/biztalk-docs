# Length (Node Property of All Schemas)

Â 

Use the **Length** property to specify a fixed length for the data in instance messages that corresponds to the selected **Field Element** or **Field Attribute** node.

## Applies to Nodes of Type

[Field Element](field-element-node-properties.md), [Field Attribute](field-attribute-node-properties.md)

## Category

Restricted

## Allowed Values

Non-negative integers. A value of zero (0) means that the corresponding element(s) or attributes in instance messages cannot have any data associated with them.

## Default Value

None.

## XSD Persistence

As the value of the **Length** element and its **value** attribute, within the **restriction** element.

## Remarks

You can examine and set this property in the Visual Studio Properties window when you select a **Field Element** node in BizTalk Editor and you have set its **Derived Type** property to **Restriction**.

This property represents a standard XSD concept related to the **simpleType** element and its **restriction** subelement.

This property applies to unordered base data types, such as **xs:string**, as well as to list-based restriction derivations, specifying the number of space-separated list items that must occur in the corresponding element(s) or attribute(s) in instance messages.

You can either specify a value for the **Length** property, or for the **Maximum Length** and/or **Minimum Length** properties, but not both.
