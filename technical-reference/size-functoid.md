# Size Functoid

 

Use the **Size** functoid ( ![](images/Aa561736.a3a598ef-7c99-4233-bb27-837654716336(BTS.80).jpeg)) to retrieve the length of the specified string.

## Input

**Parameter 1:** A string for which the length is sought.

## Output

**Output 1:** A numeric value that is the length of the string.

## Remarks

The returned length represents the number of characters in the string, as returned by the **Length** method of the **String** class in the .NET framework. In some cases, for some East Asian languages, the number of glyphs you see on the screen for a particular string may not be equal to the length returned by this functoid for that same string.

The returned length includes pad characters.
