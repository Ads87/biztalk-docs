# Expression Shape

 

You can use the **Expression** shape to enter any expression you choose in your orchestration. For example, you can make a .NET-based call to run an external program, or manipulate the values of your orchestration variables. It is generally not good practice to use it to perform high-level orchestration logic, which preferably would be visible in the orchestration drawing itself. Your orchestration is easier to understand and maintain if your Expression shapes contain simple and modular expressions.
