# Listen Shape

Â 

You use the **Listen** shape to make your orchestration wait for any one of several possible events before proceeding. The first branch for which a condition is met (a delay is reached or a message is received) is followed, and none of the other branches will run. You can add as many branches as you want. The first shape within a **Listen** branch must be either a **Delay** shape or a **Receive** shape. You can place any other shape below the initial **Receive** or **Delay** shape. You can use an activation receive in a **Listen** shape, but if one branch contains an activation receive, then all branches must contain activation receives, and no time-out can be used. The activation receive must be the first action in each branch.
