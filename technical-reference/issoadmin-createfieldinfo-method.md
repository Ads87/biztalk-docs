# ISSOAdmin.CreateFieldInfo Method

 

The **CreateFieldInfo** method creates field information for an application.

## Syntax

``` c++
  
HRESULT CreateFieldInfo(  
BSTR bstrApplicationName,  
BSTR bstrLabel,  
LONG lFlags  
);  
```

``` vb
  
Sub CreateFieldInfo(  
bstrApplicationName As String,  
bstrLabel As String,  
lFlags As Long  
)  
```

#### Parameters

bstrApplicationName  
\[in\] String that specifies the application name. This parameter cannot be NULL, an empty string, or contain spaces. Application names are not case-sensitive, but case will be preserved. For example, ABC, abc, and AbC are considered to be the same application.

bstrApplicationName  
\[in\] String that specifies the application name. This parameter cannot be NULL, an empty string, or contain spaces. Application names are not case-sensitive, but case will be preserved. For example, ABC, abc, and AbC are considered to be the same application.

bstrLabel  
\[in\] String that specifies the label value. This parameter cannot be NULL or an empty string.

bstrLabel  
\[in\] String that specifies the label value. This parameter cannot be NULL or an empty string.

lFlags  
\[in\] Long integer specifies whether the field is masked. If a field must be masked when displayed in the user interface, specify SSO\_FLAG\_FIELD\_INFO\_MASK. The flag parameter will be ignored for the first (user ID) field, as it will not be masked.

lFlags  
\[in\] Long integer specifies whether the field is masked. If a field must be masked when displayed in the user interface, specify SSO\_FLAG\_FIELD\_INFO\_MASK. The flag parameter will be ignored for the first (user ID) field, as it will not be masked.

## Remarks

The application must exist before its field information can be created. The number of fields added must equal the *numFields* value specified when the application was created, otherwise the application will be disabled at run time.

Although the external user ID is not considered to be an external credential, it requires a field to describe how it will be displayed by the user interface. The first field created will be considered as the field that describes the external user ID. A minimum of one field is required, and typically at least two fields should be specified to provide credentials. An application can have no credentials.

To access this method, you must be an SSO Administrator, SSO Affiliate Administrator, or an SSO Application Administrator.

## Requirements
