# IBaseMessage Interface (COM)

 

Represents the basic composition of the message.

For a list of all members of this type, see [IBaseMessage Members](ibasemessage-members-com.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>For information on using this interface within managed code, see the <CODE>IBaseMessage Interface</CODE>.</P>



## Remarks

This interface must be implemented for messages that get published to the database and delivered to the orchestration. The component needs to use the [CreateMessage](ibasemessagefactory-createmessage-method-com.md) method of the [IBaseMessageFactory](ibasemessagefactory-interface-com.md) interface to create a new message object in memory.
