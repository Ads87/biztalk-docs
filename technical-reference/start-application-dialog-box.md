# Start Application Dialog Box

 

Use the **Start Application** dialog box to start all dependent artifacts and applications in one transaction.

When you open this dialog box, it is displayed in a collapsed form (without the **Options** or **Referenced Applications** tab visible) if all applications that the current application references are already running. If any of the referenced applications has not already been started when you open this dialog box to start the current application, the dialog box will open with the **Details** portion of the dialog box expanded so that you can see the referenced applications that will also be started.
