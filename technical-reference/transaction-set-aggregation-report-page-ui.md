# Transaction Set Aggregation Report Page UI

Â 

The properties included in this page define which transaction sets will be included in the Transaction Set Aggregation status report. The transaction set report will show all transaction sets that are processed by the EDI send and receive pipelines and that meet the criteria defined on this page.

The Transaction Set Aggregation Report page is displayed by clicking the BizTalk Group node in the console tree of the BizTalk Server Administration Console, and then clicking **Transaction Set Aggregation Report** in the right pane.

In this status report, you can get the status for transaction sets. The results pane will include the following data (if all columns are included):

  - Transaction Set ID

  - Transaction Set Count

  - Sender party

  - Receiver party

  - Direction

  - Earliest Started Date/Time
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>For received documents, if the date specified in the interchange is YYMMDD format and YY is greater than or equal to 75, BizTalk Server will display the year as 19YY. If the date is less than 75, it will be displayed as 20YY.</P>
    > <P>For example, if you receive an interchange that contains the value 991113 in ISA09, the Earliest Started Date/Time will be listed in the report as 11/13/1999.</P>



  - Latest Ended Date/Time

If you right-click anywhere in the Results pane, you will see an **Add/Remove Columns** command that you can use to make changes to the columns in the result.
