# Message Details Properties Dialog Box

Â 

Use the **Message Details Properties** window to view details of messages in the message box. You cannot edit messages or message properties, but you can turn on message tracking and save the message to another location. The maximum message part size that the **Message Details Properties** window can display is one megabyte (MB); the complete message may be larger than 1 MB, but no single part may be. If a message part is too large to be displayed in the message viewer, you must open the message part using a third-party program. The same window is used for message routing failure reports, in which case, the window title will be "Routing failure report for Message \<Message GUID\>."

## Context Tab

Use this tab to view system-specific and component-specific properties, such as adapters and pipeline components properties, for the selected message. The properties that appear depend primarily on which component processed the message. To view properties for a message, click the link associated with the adapter that processed the message.

### System Properties

System properties are those used internally by the BizTalk Server messaging engine and its components.

### MIME Components Properties

MIME components properties are those used to set message and part context properties for MIME encoding.

### BTF Components Properties

BizTalk Framework (BTF) properties are used to set message and part context properties for the BizTalk Framework Disassembler pipeline component.

### XML Normalization Components Properties

XML Normalization or "XML Norm" refers to the conversion of messages from custom formats into XML representation. XML Norm properties are set and used by XML and flat file assemblers and disassemblers.

### Error Report properties

At each point along the pathway that a message follows through the BizTalk Server messaging subsystem, failures can occur in the BizTalk Server infrastructure and in custom pipeline components, orchestrations, and so forth. If you have specified error reporting for the port through which a message is entering or will leave, BizTalk Server publishes an error report message derived from the failing message. The Error Report message is routed to the subscribing routing destination, such as a send port or orchestration; all previously promoted properties are demoted and selected properties related to the specific messaging failure are promoted to the message context. For more information, see [Using Failed Message Routing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa578516\(v=bts.80\)).

### Message Tracking Properties

The BizTalk Server engine uses Message tracking properties internally to preserve tracking-specific information.

## Body Tab

You use the **Body** tab to view messages in either text or binary format. Ability to view the message body is controlled by role-based access; if you do not have the required privileges to view the message, you will see a message to that effect. The **Body** tab has two subordinate tabs, which you select on the right-hand side of the window; these are the **Text** tab and the **Binary** tab.

### Text Tab

Click the **Text** tab to view the message in ASCII characters, if the message is decodable.

### Binary Tab

Click the **Binary** tab to view the message in binary form.

## File Menu

Use the **File** menu to track or save messages, or to exit from the **Message Details** window. The **File** menu displays the following options:

  - **Save Message**. Click to display the **Save Message** dialog box.

  - **Track Message**. Click to turn on message tracking for the displayed message. A confirmation window appears that requires you to confirm the tracking request. If the message is no longer in the Message Box (terminated or completed), an error message informs you that the message is no longer available.

  - **Exit**. Click to close the **Message Details Properties** window.
