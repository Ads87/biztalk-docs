# Send Ports Node, Details Pane

Â 

Use the Send Ports node details pane to manage send ports in the application. Right-click a specific send port to display the following commands:

  - **Start**. Starts the send port, which allows messages to be routed to it and delivered to the destination.

  - **Stop**. Stops the send port and disables activation subscriptions so that new port instances cannot be created but current processes can finish.

  - **Enlist**. Sets activation subscriptions to disabled so that new port instances cannot be created but current processes can finish. Enables messages to be routed to the send port for transmission.

  - **Un-enlist**. Removes the activation subscription so that no messages will be routed to the port.

  - **Move To Application**. Displays the **Move to Application** dialog box, which you use to move artifacts from the current application in the Administrative Console to a different application.

  - **Tracking**. Displays the **Send Port Tracking Options** window. This window is identical to the **Tracking** tab in the **Send Port Properties** window.

  - **Delete**. Deletes the send port.

  - **Properties**. Displays the **Send Port Properties** window.
