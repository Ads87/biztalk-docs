# Batch Filter Page

 

This topic describes the fields in the **Batch Filter** page of the **EDI Properties** dialog box. This page is displayed by right-clicking a party in the **Parties** node of the BizTalk Server Administration Console, clicking **EDI Properties**, clicking **Batches**, and then clicking **Filter** in the **Batches** page.

In this page, you create a set of filter criteria for determining which messages will be picked up by the batching orchestration and included in the batch.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>When making changes to the batch filter, it will take 15 minutes for the new filter settings to take effect. This refresh time cannot be changed.</P>
