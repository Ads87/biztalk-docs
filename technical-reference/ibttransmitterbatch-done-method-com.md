<td>If the <strong>Done</strong> method fails, the Messaging Engine will deal with all of the individual messages in the batch in the following manner:<br />
<br />
- If the message has retries remaining, it will be resubmitted, the Messaging Engine will use the retry interval stamped on the message.<br />
- If the retries have been exhausted for this message, the Messaging Engine will attempt to move the message to the backup transport.<br />
- If the Messaging Engine cannot move the message to its backup transport, the Messaging Engine will suspend the message.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


**Remarks**

This method is called by the BizTalk Server Messaging Engine when either the batch is full or the BizTalk Server Messaging Engine does not have any more messages for this batch. The adapter will transmit all the messages in the batch when the **Done** method is called.
