# Base Type (Node Property of All Schemas)

Â 

Use the **Base Type** property to examine the base complex type for the selected **Equivalent** node.

## Applies to Nodes of Type

[Equivalent](equivalent-node-properties.md)

## Category

General

## Read-Only Value

The name of the base data type for an **Equivalent** node.

## XSD Persistence

None. The **Equivalent** node and its properties exist to display the type derivations occurring within the XSD, but have no direct XSD persistence. The values of the **Base Data Type** and **Data Structure Type** properties of the associated nodes can be viewed as a form of indirect XSD persistence.

## Remarks

You can examine this property in the Visual Studio Properties window when you select an **Equivalent** node in BizTalk Editor.
