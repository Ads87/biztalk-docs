# Export MSI File Wizard, Select Resources Page

 

Use the **Select Resources** page to select the artifacts to export into an .msi file. Only the artifacts that you select will be included.

If you select the Bindings check box, all of the application's bindings will be included. If you then import this .msi file into an existing application, all of the bindings in the existing application that have the same name as bindings in this file will be overwritten with the bindings in this file.

If you select Global Parties, all of the party information for the group will be exported into the .msi file.
