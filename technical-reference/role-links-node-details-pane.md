# Role Links Node, Details Pane

Â 

Use the Role Links node details pane to control and manage role links in the application. Right-click a specific role link to display the following commands:

  - **Remove**. Removes the selected role link from the application and undeploys the assembly that contains it and the other components of that assembly. The application must be stopped before you can remove a role link.

  - **Move To Application**. Displays the **Move to Application** dialog box, which you use to move artifacts from the current application in the Administrative Console to a different application.

  - **Properties**. Displays the **Role Link Properties** window.
