# Send Port Groups Node, Details Pane

Â 

Use the Send Port Groups node details pane to manage send port groups in the application. Right-click a specific send port group to display the following commands:

  - **Start**. Starts the send port group, which allows messages to be routed to it and delivered to the destination. At least one contained send port must be enlisted or started before messages can be transmitted.

  - **Stop**. Stops the send port group and its associated send ports.

  - **Enlist**. Enlists the send port group and all associated send ports. Enlisting the send port group enables messages to be routed to the send port group.

  - **Un-enlist**. Un-enlists the send port group and its associated send ports. Messages will no longer be routed to that send port group.

  - **Move To Application**. Displays the **Move to Application** dialog box, which you use to move artifacts from the current application in the Administrative Console to a different application.

  - **Delete**. Deletes the send port group.

  - **Properties**. Displays the **Send Port Group Properties** window.
