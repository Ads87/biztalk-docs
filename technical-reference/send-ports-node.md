# Send Ports Node

Â 

Use the **Send Ports** node to display existing send ports, create new send ports, and refresh send port information. Right-click the **Send Ports** node to display the following commands:

  - **New**. This menu item displays a submenu containing the following commands:
    
      - **Static One-way Send Port**. Creates a new static one-way send port and displays the **Send Port Properties** window, where you can configure the new send port. A static, one-way port is associated with a specified destination address and transport type and transmits data in only one direction.
    
      - **Static Solicit-Response Send Port**. Creates a new static solicit-response send port and displays the **Send Port Properties** window, where you can configure the new send port. A static port is associated with a specified destination address and transport type. A solicit-response port queries the destination for a message, waits for a response message, and then submits the response message back to the server.
    
      - **Dynamic One-way Send Port**. Creates a new dynamic one-way send port and displays the **Send Port Properties** window, where you can configure the new send port. A dynamic port does not specify a destination address and transport type; the destination address and transport type are associated with the port during runtime. A one-way port transmits data in one direction.
    
      - **Dynamic Solicit-Response Send Port**. Creates a new dynamic solicit-response send port and displays the **Send Port Properties** window, where you can configure the new send port. A dynamic solicit-response send port both specifies the destination address and transport type at runtime and queries the destination for a message before submitting a response.
