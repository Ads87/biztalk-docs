# Group Shape

 

You can use the **Group** shape to group actions in an intuitive and visually manageable way. You can collapse or expand a task to show or hide the actions within it, which can be helpful when working with large, complicated orchestrations. It is not saved as part of the underlying code—it is a graphical construct for your convenience.

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Report to Analyst</strong> property</td>
<td>Select <strong>True</strong> if you want to make this shape viewable in the Visual Business Analyst Tool.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
