# Escape Character (Node Property of Flat File Schemas)

Â 

Use the **Escape Character** property to configure, on a per-record basis, the character used to escape characters that have been given special meanings, allowing their basic meaning to be used.

## Applies to Nodes of Type

[Record](record-node-properties.md)

## Category

Flat File

## Allowed Values

Either:

  - No value, resulting in no corresponding annotation in the XSD representation of the schema and specifying that there is no escape character defined for the currently selected **Record** node.

  - Any of the predefined character choices in the drop-down list.

  - Any other single character entered in the format indicated by your choice for the [Escape Character Type](escape-character-type-node-property-of-flat-file-schemas.md) property.

## Default Value

No value, resulting in no annotation being added to the XSD representation of the schema.

## XSD Persistence

As the value of the **escape\_char** attribute of the **element/annotation/appinfo/recordInfo** annotation element.

## Remarks

You can examine and set this property in the Visual Studio Properties window when you select a **Record** node (including a root **Record** node) in BizTalk Editor and you have configured the **Flat File Extension** option for the **Schema Editor Extensions** property of the **Schema** node.

You must configure the **Escape Character Type** property as **Character** or **Hexadecimal** before you can configure this property.

The escape character is ignored when used with a regular character (non-escape, non-wrap, non-effective delimiters) or as a last character in the message.
