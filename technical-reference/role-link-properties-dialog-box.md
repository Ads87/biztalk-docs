# Role Link Properties Dialog Box

 

Use the **Role Link Properties** window to configure the relationship between two services or orchestrations by defining the part played by each service and specifying the port types provided by each role. You create service link roles in the Role Link Wizard, but if you need to configure service link roles after you have created them, you do so in the **Role Link Properties** window.
