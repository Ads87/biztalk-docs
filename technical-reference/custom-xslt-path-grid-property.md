# Custom XSLT Path (Grid Property)

 

Use the **Custom XSLT Path** property to open the **Select Custom XSLT File** dialog box, in which you can select the file that contains the custom XSLT for the map.

## Category

Compiler

## Allowed Values

Valid name of a file that contains the custom XSLT for the map, if any.

Either type the full path name of the file, or use the ellipsis (**...**) button on the right side of the input field to open the **Select Custom XSLT File** dialog box.

## Default Value

None.

## Remarks

If you specify custom XSLT by using this property, it completely replaces any XSLT that would normally be generated by the map. In other words, if this property is set, any links and functoids in the grid are irrelevant.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You cannot undo or redo the <STRONG>Custom XSLT Path</STRONG> property.</P>
