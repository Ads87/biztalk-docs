# Property Schema Base (Node Property of Property Schemas)

Â 

Use the **Property Schema Base** property to specify the origin of the data associated with the selected **Field Element** node. The data can originate in either the instance message itself or from another source, such as the envelope in which the instance message is enclosed.

## Applies to Nodes of Type

[Field Element](field-element-node-properties.md)

## Allowed Values

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>MessageDataPropertyBase</strong></td>
<td>Use this value to specify that the value associated with the selected <strong>Field Element</strong> node originates from a promoted property within an associated document schema.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>MessageContextPropertyBase</strong></td>
<td>Use this value to specify that the value associated with the selected <strong>Field Element</strong> node may or may not originate from a promoted property within an associated document schema.<br />
<br />
Most built-in BizTalk Server context properties are of this type, as well as values that originate in the envelope portion of an incoming instance message.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>PartContextPropertyBase</strong></td>
<td>Use this value to specify the runtime that the value for the property will be part of the MessagePart context.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>(Default)</strong></td>
<td>Removes the corresponding annotation in the XSD representation of the schema, if any, resulting in the same behavior as the <strong>MessageDataPropertyBase</strong> setting.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Default Value

**(Default)**, resulting in no corresponding annotation in the XSD representation of the schema, and producing the same behavior as the **MessageDataPropertyBase** setting.

## XSD Persistence

As the value of the **propSchFieldBase** (="MessageDataPropertyBase" or "MessageContextPropertyBase") attribute of the **element/annotation/appinfo/fieldInfo** annotation element.

## Remarks

You can examine and set this property in the Visual Studio Properties window when you are editing a property schema and you select a **Field Element** node in BizTalk Editor.

When this property is set to **MessageDataPropertyBase** for the selected **Field Element** node, it references its value in the instance message using an XPath. Furthermore, in order for the selected **Field Element** node value to be accessible to orchestrations, some node in the corresponding document schema must be promoted to this **Field Element** node.

When this property is set to **MessageContextPropertyBase** for the selected **Field Element** node, its value is always available within orchestrations, regardless of any property promotions in the corresponding document schema.
