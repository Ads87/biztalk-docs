# Default Escape Character (Node Property of Flat File Schemas)

Â 

Use the **Default Escape Character** property to configure, for the entire schema, the character used to escape characters that have been given special meanings, allowing their basic meaning to be used.

## Applies to Nodes of Type

[Schema](schema-node-properties.md)

## Category

Flat File

## Allowed Values

Either:

  - No value, resulting in no corresponding annotation in the XSD representation of the schema. This value is only allowed when the [Default Escape Character Type](default-escape-character-type-node-property-of-flat-file-schemas.md) property is set to **None**.

  - Any of the predefined character choices in the drop-down list.

  - Any other single character entered in the format indicated by your choice for the **Default Escape Character Type** property.

## Default Value

No value, resulting in no annotation being added to the XSD representation of the schema.

## XSD Persistence

As the value of the **default\_escape\_char** attribute of the **schema/annotation/appinfo/schemaInfo** element.

## Remarks

You can examine and set this property in the Visual Studio Properties window when you select the **Schema** node in BizTalk Editor and you have configured the **Flat File Extension** option for the **Schema Editor Extensions** property of that node.

You must configure the **Default Escape Character Type** property as **Character** or **Hexadecimal** before you can configure this property.

You can override the global setting established by this property by setting the [Escape Character](escape-character-node-property-of-flat-file-schemas.md) property for individual **Record** nodes.

The escape character is ignored when used with a regular character (non-escape, non-wrap, non-effective delimiters) or as a last character in the message.
