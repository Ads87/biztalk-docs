# File Name (Map Item Property)

 

Use the **File Name** property to change the name of the map file, which is also the name of the map itself.

## Category

Miscellaneous

## Allowed Values

Valid file names can be entered as for the value of this property.

## Default Value

The name of the map when it was created. By default, map names have the form "Map*N*.btm", where "*N*" is a monotonically increasing number starting with one (1).

## Remarks

The value of the [Type Name](type-name-map-item-property.md) property does not change automatically when you change the value of the **File Name** property. If you want to keep them the same, you must change the **Type Name** property manually.
