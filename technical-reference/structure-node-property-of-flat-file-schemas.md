## XSD Persistence

As the value of the **structure** (="delimited" or "positional") attribute of the **element/annotation/appinfo/recordInfo** annotation element.

## Remarks

You can examine and set this property in the Visual Studio Properties window when you select a **Record** node (including a root **Record** node) in BizTalk Editor and you have configured the **Flat File Extension** option for the **Schema Editor Extensions** property of the **Schema** node.

The setting of this property plays a major role in determining which other properties are available (visible).
