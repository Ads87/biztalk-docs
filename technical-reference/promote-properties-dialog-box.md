# Promote Properties Dialog Box

 

Use the **Promote Properties** dialog box to manage both types of property promotion: distinguished fields and property fields, where each type of promoted property is managed using its own tab on the right side of the dialog box.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Promoted properties are restricted to non-repeating elements/attributes.</P>
