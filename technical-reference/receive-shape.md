# Receive Shape

 

Use the **Receive** shape to receive a message from a port. You can use it to start an orchestration by setting the **Activate** property to **True**, so that a message matching criteria specified in a filter expression will be received and the orchestration instance will execute. You can apply a correlation set to ensure that you correctly receive messages that correspond to a given instance of your orchestration.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Use this</th>
<th>To do this</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Activate</strong> property</td>
<td>Specify whether this is an activation receive by selecting <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>. If <strong>True</strong>, the <strong>Receive</strong> shape must be the first action in the orchestration. If <strong>False</strong>, your orchestration must be called by another orchestration in order to run. <strong>Note:</strong> Each orchestration must have at least one <strong>Receive</strong> shape with the <strong>Activate</strong> property set to <strong>True</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Filter Expression</strong> property</td>
