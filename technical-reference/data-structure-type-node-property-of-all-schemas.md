# Data Structure Type (Node Property of All Schemas)

 

Use the **Data Structure Type** property to:

  - Select an existing global complex type to be associated with the selected **Record** node, thereby converting the inbuilt complex type for this **Record** node to a global complex type.
    
    \- or -

  - Specify a name for the complex type associated with the selected **Record** node, thereby converting its unnamed complex type to a global complex type, or,
    
    \- or -

  - Reference an existing global **Record** node.

## Applies to Nodes of Type

[Record](record-node-properties.md)

## Category

General

## Allowed Values

Valid qualified names (QNames).

## Default Value

None.

## XSD Persistence

When you choose an existing complex type, or type a new complex type name for this property, it is persisted as the value of **type** attribute of the element that corresponds to the selected **Record** node.

When you choose to refer to an existing global Record node, this property value is persisted as the value of the **ref** attribute of the element that corresponds to the selected **Record** node.

## Remarks

You can examine and set this property in the Visual Studio Properties window when you select a **Record** node in BizTalk Editor.

This property represents a standard XSD construct. For additional information about the corresponding XSD construct, see [XSD Resources on the Web](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa547363\(v=bts.80\)).

If the value of this property is blank, the complex type of the underlying **Record** node is unnamed, and therefore cannot be used by any other **Record** node. If you type a new name for this property, the underlying complex type becomes global and can be used as the value of the **Data Structure Type** or **Base Data Type** property of other **Record** nodes. You can also select a value from a list of existing global named complex types using the drop-down list, or type a name of an existing complex type to reuse that type.

Further, you can also use this property to reference an existing global **Record** node by choosing it from the drop-down list.

In summary, the drop-down list for this property has two types of entries in it:

  - Existing global named complex types

  - Existing global Record nodes

And because the property field is editable, you can provide a name for an already present, unnamed complex type.
