# Sine Functoid

 

Use the **Sine** functoid ( ![](images/Aa561631.858e7775-ff7e-4c62-9f1c-a24c7d7cb488(BTS.80).jpeg)) to return the sine of an angle.

## Input

**Parameter 1:** A numeric value that is an angle, specified in radians, for which the sine is sought.

## Output

**Output 1:** A numeric value that is the sine of the specified angle.

## Remarks

This functoid performs the following trigonometric calculation, where for a right triangle, A is one of the acute angles, H is the length of the hypotenuse, and O is the length of the side opposite the angle.

Sine(A) = O / H (sine of angle is the opposite side over the hypotenuse)

A radian is a unit of measure of angles, such that there are 2π radians in a circle. It follows that:

  - 2π radians equals 360 degrees

  - 1 radian = 180/π degrees

  - 1 degree = π/180 radians
