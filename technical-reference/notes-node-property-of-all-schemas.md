# Notes (Node Property of All Schemas)

Â 

Use the **Notes** property to enter notes, such as comments that are related to the business process, that you would like to make about the selected **Record**, **Field Element**, or **Field Attribute** node.

## Applies to Nodes of Type

[Record](record-node-properties.md), [Field Element](field-element-node-properties.md), [Field Attribute](field-attribute-node-properties.md)

## Category

BizTalk

## Allowed Values

Any string, without a specific maximum limit. In practice, however, it is not advisable to burden your schemas with very large notes.

## Default Value

None.

## XSD Persistence

For **Record** nodes, as the value of the **notes** attribute of the **element/annotation/appinfo/recordInfo** element.

For **Field Element** nodes, as the value of the **notes** attribute of the **element/annotation/appinfo/fieldInfo** element.

For **Field Attribute** nodes, as the value of the **notes** attribute of the **attribute/annotation/appinfo/fieldInfo** element.

## Remarks

You can examine and set this property in the Visual Studio Properties window when you select a **Record**, **Field Element**, or **Field Attribute** node in BizTalk Editor.

You can type notes directly into the **Notes** property value field, or you can click the ellipsis (**...**) button located to the right of the **Notes** property value field to open the **Notes** dialog box, in which you can type your notes into a multi-line edit box.

For example, you might want to provide a note when a particular element in an instance message contains confidential information. You might then want to add note to the corresponding **Record** or **Field Element** node that says:

"The data in this record is confidential. Do not distribute it outside this company."

Such a note might prevent someone creating a map with this schema from inadvertently mapping that data into instance messages that circulate outside the company.
