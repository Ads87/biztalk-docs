# AS2 Message and Correlated MDN Status Page UI

 

The properties included in this page define which AS2 messages processed by the AS2 send and receive pipelines and their correlated MDNs will be included in the AS2/MDN status report.

The AS2/MDN Status page is displayed by clicking the BizTalk Group node in the console tree of the BizTalk Server Administration Console, and then clicking **AS2 MDN Status** in the right pane.

In this status report, the results pane will include the following data (if all columns are included):

  - Sender party

  - Receiver party

  - AS2 From

  - AS2 To

  - AS2 MessageID

  - AS2 Message Date Time

  - Received Date Time

  - Party role

  - MDN Status

  - Encryption Status

  - Signature Status

  - Edi Interchange Control No

  - Is AS2 Message Duplicate

  - Days to check for duplicate

  - Filename

  - Reliable messaging enabled

If you right-click a row in the query results in the AS2 Message and Correlated MDN Status page, you will see a **View Related Interchange** command that you can use to display a page showing the interchanges related to the batch. The fields of the query for this command will be populated with values that are specific to the row that you right-click. You will also get commands enabling you to display the message wire format, decoded message, or MDN message (in text or binary format).

If you right-click a row that display the Receiver party role, you will see a **View Reliable Messaging Status** command that you can use to display a history of resend attempts for this message. The fields displayed for this command will be populated with values that are specific to the row that you right-click.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The <STRONG>View Reliable Messaging Status</STRONG> command will only be available for parties that are configured with the <STRONG>Resend AS2 message if MDN not received</STRONG> property on the Party as AS2 Message Receiver page of the party AS2 Properties page.</P>



If you right-click anywhere in the Results pane, you will see an **Add/Remove Columns** command that you can use to make changes to the columns in the result.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>There is no wild-card support in any of the query fields, operators, or values.</P>
